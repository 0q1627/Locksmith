function Find-ESC16 {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This script finds Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) Certification Authorities (CA) that have the ESC16 vulnerability.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The script takes an array of ADCS objects as input and filters them based on objects that have the objectClass
        'pKIEnrollmentService' and the szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT disabled. For each matching object, it creates a custom object with
        properties representing various information about the object, such as Forest, Name, DistinguishedName, Technique,
        Issue, Fix, and Revert.

    .PARAMETER ADCSObjects
        Specifies the array of AD CS objects to be processed. This parameter is mandatory.

    .OUTPUTS
        The script outputs an array of custom objects representing the matching ADCS objects and their associated information.
